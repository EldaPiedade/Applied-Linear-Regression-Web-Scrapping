# FINAL_PROJEC_DATA_4310
The Data On this  Repository was gathered at https://texas.hometownlocator.com/tx/houston/ for use at Scholars Academy TTC Program by Elda Piedade.

# Abstract

The objective of this research is to implement Linear Regression, Deep Learning and Neural Network algorithms to predict the median home value for Houston zip codes.  By way of statistical analysis inferences will be made about the population, that is, all Houston zip codes. 
Data is only usefully to the point that you can make inferences or predictions to solve a problem or gather information about a subject. For this project I was particularly interested to learn more about the Houston housing market. Therefore, data of 96 out of the total zip codes in Houston was gathered and utilized for descriptive and inferential statistics to understand the relationship between median home value and other variables available, such us diversity index and per capita income. For the next stage of the research data was modeled with linear regression and sequential neural network by Keras. With two models available I was able to evaluate which made better predictions by using the root mean square error metric.
